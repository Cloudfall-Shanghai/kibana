[[access]]
== Access {kib}

The fastest way to access {kib} is to use our hosted {es} Service. If you <<install, installed {kib} on your own>>, access {kib} through the web application.

[float]
=== Set up on cloud

[[log-on-to-the-web-application]]
=== Log on to the web application

If you are using a self-managed deployment, access {kib} through the web application on port 5601.

. Point your web browser to the machine where you are running {kib} and specify the port number. For example, `localhost:5601` or `http://YOURDOMAIN.com:5601`.
+
To remotely connect to {kib}, set <<server-host,server.host>> to a non-loopback address.

. Log on to your account.

. Go to the home page, then click *{kib}*.

. To make the {kib} page your landing page, click *Make this my landing page*.

[float]
[[status]]
=== Check the {kib} status

The status page displays information about the server resource usage and installed plugins.

To view the {kib} status page, use the status endpoint. For example, `localhost:5601/status`.

For JSON-formatted server status details, use the `localhost:5601/api/status` API endpoint.

[[not-ready]]
=== Troubleshoot {kib} UI error

Troubleshoot the `Kibana Server is not Ready yet` error.

. From within a {kib} node, confirm the connection to {es}:
+
[source,sh]
----
curl -XGET elasticsearch_ip_or_hostname:9200/
----
. Guarantee the health of the three {kib}-backing indices.  All indices must appear and display `status:green` and `status:open`:
+
[source,sh]
----
curl -XGET elasticsearch_ip_or_hostname:9200/_cat/indices/.kibana,.kibana_task_manager,.kibana_security_session?v=true
----
These {kib}-backing indices must also not have {ref}/indices-get-settings.html[index settings] flagging `read_only_allow_delete` or `write` {ref}/index-modules-blocks.html[index blocks]. 
. <<start-stop,Shut down all {kib} nodes>>. 
. Choose any {kib} node, then update the config to set the <<change-overall-log-level,debug logging>>.
. <<start-stop,Start the node>>, then check the start-up debug logs for `ERROR` messages or other start-up issues. 
+
For example:

* When {kib} is unable to connect to a healthy {es} cluster, errors like `master_not_discovered_exception` or `unable to revive connection` or `license is not available` errors appear.
* When one or more {kib}-backing indices are unhealthy, the `index_not_green_timeout` error appears.

[[index-write-block]]
=== Troubleshoot {kib} index write block

{kib} temporarily sets an {ref}/index-modules-blocks.html[{es} index `write` block] during its upgrade's <<saved-object-migrations,Saved Object Migration>>. If it is unable to successfully complete this migration, it may not reset this override for its `.kibana*` backing indices and so the {kib} logs will error variations like 

[source,text]
----
[.kibana] blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/8/index write (api)];: cluster_block_exception Root causes: cluster_block_exception: index [.kibana] blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/8/index write (api)];
----

This can occur when 

* an {ess} or {ece} Deployment upgrade plan is cancelled by user

* {es} is experiencing an underlying issue during {kib}'s migration, most commonly related to {es} errors 
+
* {ref}/size-your-shards.html#troubleshooting-max-shards-open[`this action would add [x] total shards, but this cluster currently has [y]/[z] maximum shards open`]
* {ref}/fix-watermark-errors.html[`disk usage exceeded flood-stage watermark, index has read-only-allow-delete block`]

The underlying {es} issue should be resolved first. Afterwards, you may need to manually resolve by either

* removing the {es} index write block via an {ref}/indices-update-settings.html[update index settings]
+ 
[source,console]
----
PUT .kibana*/_settings?expand_wildcards=all
{"index.blocks.write":null }
----

* <<upgrade-migrations-rolling-back,rollback to previous version of {kib}>>
